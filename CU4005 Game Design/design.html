<p class="text2"> These are the games that I along with other different people have designed so far:</p>
<ol>
<li class="text"> Kingdom Counters </li>
<p class="text2"> Teammates: David, Tom & Bashir</p>
<ul>
<li class="text2">This game for 2 players and 4 players. It can also be played by 3 players, however, one of the players will be at a disadvantage as they would be stuck between the other 2 players.</li>
<li class="text2">Requiremenets: Blue, yellow, green and red counters, a 12x12 grid with marked town centres and a dice.</li>
<li class="text2">The game is set on a 12x12 grid. Each player uses a coloured counter, either red, yellow, blue or green.</li>
<li class="text2">The first counter of each player is placed on a corner of the grid, which is considered to be your town centre.</li>
<li class="text2">There are also 4 other unclaimed town centres located 3 squares diagonally from each player's corner.</li>
<li class="text2">To place an extra counter on an unoccupied square or town centre, you have to roll a 1.</li>
<li class="text2">To place an extra counter on an square occupied by an enemy counter and take out their counter, you have to roll a 2.</li>
<li class="text2">To occupy an enemy town centre, you have to roll a 3.</li>
<li class="text2">You can only place counters to the side of any other counter you have placed on the grid, but not diagonally.</li>
<li class="text2">If you circle around an entire region, including the corners, that whole region becomes yours and is filled with your counters, even if it contains enemy counters.</li>
<li class="text2">A player loses if all their town centres have been occupied, however, the rest of their counters will still remain on the grid, but the player won't be able to play.</li>
<li class="text2">To win a game, you have to take over all 8 town centres on the grid.</li>
</ul>

<li class="text"> Global Exploit </li>
<p class="text2"> Teammates: Kim & Kristin</p>
<ul>
<li class = "text2">This is a computer game for 2 to 4 players.</li>
<li class = "text2">The game has 3 different environments: Desert, Mountain and Forest. Every kind of resource can be found in every kind of environement, but some resources are a lot more abundant in certain environments.</li>
<li class = "text2">Every player has a randomized starting point on the map, all having a different environment.</li>
<li class = "text2">The Desert has a higher chance of finding oil and sand.</li>
<li class = "text2">The Mountain has a higher chance of finding gold, coal and stone.</li>
<li class = "text2">The Forest has a higher chance of finding wood, water and food.</li>
<li class = "text2">The wood, stone and sand are resources that are only used for building houses. Houses help with the amount of humans you can have in total.</li>
<li class = "text2">Food and water are resources required to keep your humans alive and to allow them to reproduce. The more food and water you have collected, the more humans can be kept alive.</li>
<li class = "text2">Having a higher population of humans also allows you to take over more unexplored teritorry and increases your strength, meaning that they are also the way to take over an enemy teritorry, but it costs more humans.</li>
<li class = "text2">Oil, gold and coal are resources that add to your overall score, with oil being worth 5 points per litre, gold being worth 3 points per gold ore piece and coal being worth 1 point per coal piece.</li>
<li class = "text2">Oil, gold and coal are not shown on the map once you discover an area and they are hidden underground. To dig out oil, gold and coal, you have to build and excavation site, which costs wood and stone.</li>
<li class = "text2">The player that has the most points at the end of the game wins. The game has adjustable timer based on the host's choice, ranging from 10 to 60 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<li class="text"> Snappy Snap-Snap </li>
<p class="text2"> Teammates: Kim, Stefano & David</p>
<ul>
<li class = "text2"> This game is for 4 players only.</li>
<li class = "text2"> Requirements: A coin, a magazine and 2 identical decks of cards. The magazine is placed on the centre of the table and the coin on the centre of the magazine.</li>
<li class = "text2"> 1 player from both teams is assigned the role of the dealer. The dealer receives a deck of cards. </li>
<li class = "text2"> The other players are assigned the roles of the snappers. They have to keep one hand on the corner of the table and cover their eyes with their left hand. (No peeking!) </li>
<li class = "text2"> The dealers sit diagonally from each other, same as the coin snappers. </li>
<li class = "text2"> The dealers have to deal 1 card at a time: Dealer 1 --> Dealer 2 --> Dealer 1 --> Dealer 2 --> etc. </li>
<li class = "text2"> When 2 cards dealt by both dealers are the same (color doesn't matter), it's a snap! </li>
<li class = "text2"> When a snap happens, the dealers have to quickly tap their partner to signal them that they can touch the coin. </li>
<li class = "text2"> When the coin snapper is tapped, they have to quickly touch the coin before the opposing snapper, while still keeping one hand covering their eyes. </li>
<li class = "text2"> The team that first touches the coin gets a point. </li>
<li class = "text2"> Game ends after all cards are dealt and the team with most points wins. </li>
